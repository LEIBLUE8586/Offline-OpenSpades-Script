# Openspades Offline PMS

# About
Oddly named but its a abreviation. Plugin/Mod Stuff. Openspades Offline PMS is a
as stated, Plugin/Mod Stuff for you to safely play Openspades without any Internet Connection!
a simple and fine way to have fun. Inspired a bit with the Counter Strike 1.6 New Game menu, this AoS script/app is to open a localhost/offline server using piqueserver module/script or whatever idk what it is. have fun!

# How to use
First install python 3.10 since it is somehow the only python it would work with (tell me if it can run in latest, it would be nice). Then go make the universe, then make humans, angels, demons, animals, and everything. wait probably 2025 or some thousands of years,

then lastly, open the script and use it and thats it after Python's installation.

Thats all. any comments will help this project :v
